However, figuring out the optimal number of Forge Points to donate can be tricky without a precise tool. The FOE Arche calculator simplifies this by calculating the exact FPs needed to secure specific reward positions and maximize your returns.</p>

<h2>Key Features of the FOE Arche Calculator</h2>
<h2>1. <strong>Precise Donation Calculations</strong></h2>
<p>The calculator determines the exact number of Forge Points required to secure the top reward spots (1st through 5th place) on a Great Building. It factors in the current level of the building and the total FPs needed to level it up.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Calculates FP amounts for each reward position</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Avoids guesswork and over-donating</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Helps players save valuable resources</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>2. <strong>Incorporates The Arche Bonus</strong></h2>
<p>The Arche increases the rewards you get from donating to other Great Buildings by a percentage that grows with its level. The calculator integrates this bonus, showing your actual profit after applying the multiplier.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Displays net rewards factoring in Arche's contribution bonus</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Helps players understand the true value of their donations</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>3. <strong>Safe Spot Locking</strong></h2>
<p>One of the biggest challenges in FOE donations is "sniping," where another player outbids your donation at the last moment. The FOE Arche calculator calculates the minimum safe donation needed to lock in your reward spot, reducing the risk of being overtaken.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Provides minimum FP to secure a position safely</p>
  </li>

    <p>Allows strategic timing and donation planning</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>4. <strong>Customizable Arc Bonus Rates</strong></h2>
<p>Different guilds or players might use different Arc bonus multipliers (e.g., 1.9, 1.95). The calculator allows users to adjust the Arc bonus rate to reflect their current Arche level or guild-specific settings.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Supports multiple Arc bonus multipliers</p>

    <p>Enables accurate calculations tailored to your situation</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Intuitive input fields</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clear output tables and summaries</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quick recalculations as donation status changes</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>6. <strong>Real-Time Updates</strong></h2>
<p>As the donation status of a Great Building changes, the calculator can be updated to reflect the new situation. This ensures players always have the latest information to make informed donation decisions.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Dynamic recalculations based on current donations</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Helps players adapt to evolving guild donation threads</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>7. <strong>Multiple Reward Spot Calculations</strong></h2>
<p>The tool calculates FP requirements for various reward positions, not just the first place. This helps players target different spots according to their FP availability and guild strategies.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Calculates for 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and further positions</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Supports flexible donation strategies</p>
  </li>
